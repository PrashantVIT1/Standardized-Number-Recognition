It is a number recognizer and this project can recognize the computerized number using feature detection but no ML model has been used. The main goal of this project was to study the features of numbers and then uses those feature to predict them using numpy and opencv.
The mentoned images can be used for testing the code.
It does not work well font size below 17-19 and also font color should be black.
